Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop.

They maintain a strict code of conduct, an unspoken creed that prioritizes loyalty to the guild and its members above all else. This hidden camaraderie ensures their survival in a world that seldom understands or accepts them. And in the center of this world, one finds Kaelen - a merchant, a craftsman, and an undeciphered enigma.","enemies":"The nameless mind flayed Duergar dwarf who killed his elder brother and drove his family from his village.","backstory":"Emerging from the silvan tapestry of his childhood, Kaelen, a son of the ancient Wood Elf lineage, was a consummate hunter who once wove his life into the primeval rhythms of the forest. But his idyllic existence was abruptly sundered when the nefarious Duergar, dread dwarves known for their cruelty and darkness, ravaged his ancestral home.\n\nIn one fateful skirmish, the oldest of the village defenders fell—his brother, the stalwart elder whom he had looked up to all his life. It was a horrific sight that pierced Kaelen's young heart, forever etching the image of the brutal dwarf executioner into his memory. The cold-hearted dwarf, after dealing the mortal blow, casually dropped a trinket—a puzzle box of exquisite workmanship and mysterious origins. Whether by fate or chance, Kaelen picked up the discarded artifact as he fled the remnants of his ruined home, a lasting memento of his brother's sacrifice. Despite years of relentless attempts, he was unable to unravel the enigmatic design of the trinket, his efforts thwarted at each turn.\n\nNow, Kaelen makes his dwelling in the cozy, albeit inconspicuous, inn at La Cun'dar, a rustic hamlet nestled within the sweeping landscape of PrimTerra. To the casual observer, he is merely a humble merchant affiliated with a local guild. Yet, beneath this veneer of respectability, Kaelen has crafted a clandestine existence. He excels in the shadowy arts of thievery, purloining valuable artifacts only to deconstruct, augment, and sell them as unique mechanical marvels.\n\nHis workmanship, an amalgamation of pilfered technology and elven artistry, is without equal. Yet, even amidst his newfound life, the puzzle trinket—the one keepsake from his past—remains an unsolvable enigma, a symbol of his lost home, and a testament to the brother he could not save. As his deft fingers continue to ply their craft, Kaelen remains a wayfarer on the road of life, forever haunted by his past, yet relentless in his journey towards a home yet undiscovered.\n","otherNotes":null},"traits":{"personalityTraits":"I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick.\n","ideals":"","bonds":"","flaws":"I’ll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless.","appearance":"Standing at a modest height, Kaelen is a figure of subtle charm and woodland grace. His lean, agile body is honed by a lifetime spent navigating the forest's challenging terrain and surviving its perilous encounters. Ashen brown hair cascades to his shoulders, occasionally tied back to prevent any hindrance during his dexterous activities.\n\nEmerald-green eyes, a marking of his Wood Elf heritage, are sharp and inquisitive. They possess an alluring depth that bespeaks a soul who has witnessed beauty and terror in equal measure, their luminous glow flickering with fragments of untold stories.\n\nThe only constant in his appearance is the intricate puzzle trinket that dangles from his neck, an unopened relic of his past. It sways gently as he moves, a reminder of the loss he carries and the mystery he is yet to solve. Kaelen, in all his elfin elegance, is a living embodiment of the captivating secret life he leads."},"preferences":{"useHomebrewContent":true,"progressionType":1,"encumbranceType":2,"ignoreCoinWeight":true,"hitPointType":1,"showUnarmedStrike":false,"showScaledSpells":true,"primarySense":5,"primaryMovement":1,"privacyType":3,"sharingType":2,"abilityScoreDisplayType":2,"enforceFeatRules":true,"enforceMulticlassRules":true,"enableOptionalClassFeatures":true,"enableOptionalOrigins":true,"enableDarkMode":false,"enableContainerCurrency":false},"configuration":{"startingEquipmentType":3,"abilityScoreType":1,"showHelpText":false},"lifestyle":null,"inventory":[{"id":1125227383,"entityTypeId":1439493548,"definition":{"id":10,"baseTypeId":701257905,"entityTypeId":701257905,"definitionKey":"701257905:10","canEquip":true,"magic":false,"name":"Leather","snippet":null,"weight":10.00,"weightMultiplier":1,"capacity":null,"capacityWeight":0,"type":"Light Armor","description":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

Puzzle Box","description":"Carved from a chunk of Stygian obsidian and metal alloys, the box's cold, dark exterior is etched with intricate geometric patterns that twist and turn, creating a labyrinthine network of lines. Small and almost imperceptible, silver etchings shimmer mysteriously under the faintest light, revealing an intricate map of shifting pathways. The stark contrast between the deep black obsidian and the vibrant etchings creates a mesmerizing tableau, like a starlit night sky as seen through a kaleidoscope.\n\nThe box's precise construction is visible in its series of interlocking panels and rotating sections, each moving with an eerie smoothness that belies the solidity of the obsidian. Despite its delicate complexity, the puzzle box is deceptively robust, showing no signs of wear or damage despite the trials of time.\n\nIt's impossible to distinguish any obvious opening or lock. Instead, the enigma of the box unfolds as an organic whole, a tantalizing interplay of form and function. The artifact is as silent as a tomb, devoid of any rattling or hint of what it might contain.","weight":0.00,"cost":null,"quantity":1,"notes":null}],"campaign":{"id":4117332,"name":"Bounty for Ths'la the Old","description":"","link":"/campaigns/4117332","publicNotes":"","dmUserId":107112152,"dmUsername":"Ze_the_Bear","characters":[{"userId":107112152,"username":"Ze_the_Bear","characterId":100768303,"characterName":"Ths'la the Old","characterUrl":"/profile/Ze_the_Bear/characters/100768303","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/17/393/636377881175914659.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp","privacyType":3,"campaignId":null,"isAssigned":true},{"userId":112995766,"username":"Weohstan","characterId":100778149,"characterName":"Weohstan","characterUrl":"/profile/Weohstan/characters/100778149","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/32783/570/1581111423-95656974.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp","privacyType":3,"campaignId":null,"isAssigned":true},{"userId":117104967,"username":"Pandazoic","characterId":100780703,"characterName":"Kaelen Cithreth","characterUrl":"/profile/Pandazoic/characters/100780703","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/25817/447/637883138501574628.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp","privacyType":3,"campaignId":null,"isAssigned":true},{"userId":117107982,"username":"JeffJefe1","characterId":100801897,"characterName":"Globbiar","characterUrl":"/profile/JeffJefe1/characters/100801897","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/34434/442/1581111423-100801897.jpeg?width=150&height=150&fit=crop&quality=95&auto=webp","privacyType":3,"campaignId":null,"isAssigned":true}]},"creatures":[],"optionalOrigins":[],"optionalClassFeatures":[],"dateModified":"2023-05-24T07:54:25.690317Z","providedFrom":"database"},"pagination":null}
